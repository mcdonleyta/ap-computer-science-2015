Response to question it wanted me to write in the code:

What happens when more than one keyword appears?
	The program picks the first one in the list of if statements
	ex:
		input = "bernie sanders is a communist"  //joking
		output = "Feel the bern!"

Actual questions:

1. The program will respond with the response associated with the keyword, even though it is in a different word.  If I put in "Rome is my fatherland" it would reply with "Tell me more about your family."
