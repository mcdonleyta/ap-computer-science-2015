Activity 2:
Depending on the precedent of the word in the if-else statement, the word may or may not be detected. If it's closer to the top of the if-else chain, then it will be detected first and overrule other keywords.

Due to the String.trim() method, there is no way to differentiate true keywords and words inside of each other.
