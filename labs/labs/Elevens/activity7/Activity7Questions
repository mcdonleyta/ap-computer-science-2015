4.a. When the game is first booted and when a new game is played

4.b.
	boolean isLegal(List<Integer> selectedCards)
	boolean anotherPlayIsPossible()

4.c. | 0 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 7 |

4.d. for(int i=0; i<cIndexes.size(); i++)
	System.println(cIntexes.get(i));

4.e. anotherPlayIsPossible() needs to run the cardIndexes() method, because it will run more efficiently without processing null values
