1. Add file from Git:
(commands I used to get the file as well as my directory)

git checkout SunnyV
git checkout master -- labs/KarelJRobot
git add labs/KarelJRobot
git commit -m "message here"
git push origin SunnyV

2. Running and compiling Example01 in KarelJRobot:

javac -d . -cp .:KarelJRobot.jar Example01.java
java -cp .:KarelJRobot.jar kareltherobot.Example01

3. Writing a new Java Class (implementing Directions) that loads example world stairworld.kwld

Uses the same command as objective to compile excepts uses different file name in place of Example01, which in this case is karelclimbsstairs

Code is hardcoded to climb stairs with implementation of turn right command to help

4. implement a robot that climbs the stairs
