Activity 2 Questions
1) A deck has a card, as in a deck is composed of cards.
2)3
3) {ace,king,queen,jack,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2}
   {spades,hearts,diamonds,clubs}
   {11,10,10,10,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1}
4) Yes, because each element is aligned to its partner; you wouldn't have an ace with a value of 4.
Activity 3 Questions
1)
public static String flip() {
int rand =(int) Math.random()*101
if( rand <33 || rand>66) {
	return "heads";
}
else
	return "tails";

}
2)
public static boolean arePermutations(int[] x, int[] y) {
int xSum=0;
int ySum=0;
for(int e:x) {
xSum+=e;
}
for(int e:y) {
ySum+=e;
}
if( xSum==ySum) 
	return true;
else
	return false;

}
3) 3,2,1,0 just swaps them them from the end to the beginning

Activity 7 Questions: //Mr. M: 15/15
1) a deck of 52 cards, with ranks A (ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack),
Q (queen), and K (king), and suits ♣ (clubs), ♦ (diamonds), ♥ (hearts), and ♠ (spades).

2)
builddeck()
shuffledeck()
dealcards()
while(!deck.empty() && !cardsOnTable.empty()) {
getMove()
checkMoveCondition()
move()
if(moveReducesCards) {
deal() 
}
checkWon()
}

3) No, because there is no getMove and player interfaces  //MR. M: Also removin  cards from the deck
4)
	a) when creating a new game and in the constructor
	b) isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible
	c) j♥ 6♣ 2♠ A♠ 4♥
	d) I put it in the code.
	e)  anotherPlayIsPossible because the cards get removed before it is called, leaving null.


Activity 8 Questions:
1) Thirteens is similar to elevens in that you need to find cards that add up to a number in a 10 card board. However, in 13s, kings are removed alone. Chances of winning 
are said to be 1/2. In 10s, there is a 13 card board where pairs that add up to 10 are removed and also the 4 face cards of the same rank. Chances of winning are 1/8.

2) The Board instance variables are initialized by calling super(args) in the constructor of the subclass. This method calls the constructor of the superclass in the subclass.

3) Abstract Methods: isLegal, anotherPlayISPossible
Yes, these methods do cover the diffrences because they specifically address the diffrences in rules between the games. This method won't work for the other games; you would need to create a new method.

Activity 9 Questions:
1) Because there are diffrences in the board size between elevens and thirteens; there is no has-a or is-a relationship between their sizes.
