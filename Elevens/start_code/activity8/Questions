//MR. M: 10/10

1. Elevens requires players to either pair two card together to get an 11 or
to pair together a king, queen, and jack. Thirteens requires that two cards
be paired to form a 13. Kings can be pulled out automatically. In Tens two cards
must be paired to form a 10. You can also have a 4 of a kind that can be pulled out.

2. The exact mechanism is the calling of the constructor in the abstract board
class which can be called by super() in the subclass. Therefore the paramaters
are passed on to the abstract board.

3. They would incorporate the rules that were described above. However the code
has not yet been implemented, so therfore there is no difference. The only code
we have is for the ElevensBoard, so Elevens will be the only code that can work

//MR. M: The abstract methods will have to be implemented differently in the Tens and Thirteens
games and will need different private helper methods to accomplish their tasks.
