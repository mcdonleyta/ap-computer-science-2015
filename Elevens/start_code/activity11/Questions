//Mr. M: 15/15

1. I ran the program 5 times with 10 games played each time. The game was only
won one time.
2. The first time 3 games were won. The second time 0 games were won. The third
time 0 games were won.
3. The only time I got consistent results was the first time when I did a 
sample size of 10.
4. Simulations help because it allows for a quicker and more reliable test that
would otherwise take a lot of resources and time.
