1. size is not an abstract method because the deck size is always
the same. 
//Mr. M: This question isn't talking about deck size but board size. The board size is 
//  simply supplied as an argument to the constructor

2.  cards is an array of cards that is intervened with by methods that modify
the contents of cards which is universal to all the games.

3. I believe it would work fine, but the use of super in ElevensBoard
constructor may need to be modified because the interface cannot have a
constructor.

//Mr. M: It wont work because Board has non-abstract functions and private variables which aren't allowed 
// in an interface
