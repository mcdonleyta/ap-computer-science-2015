1. size is not an abstract method because the deck size is always
the same. 
2.  cards is an array of cards that is intervened with by methods that modify
the contents of cards which is universal to all the games.
3. I believe it would work fine, but the use of super in ElevensBoard
constructor may need to be modified because the interface cannot have a
constructor.
