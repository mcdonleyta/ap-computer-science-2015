1. You would need a private variable of the board size, the ranks,the suits,
point values, cards, and a deck.

2. You would need to first deal the first set of cards. Then take in the user
input and check if it is valid. Then depending on the cards chosen deal back
2 or 3 cards. Then repeat. 

3. It looks complete, it has the checks to see if moves are possible which is
something I forgot to mention on the answer above. Besides that the class has a
method for every step I said above.

4. a. line 59, or after the deck is created and the game is created.
b. One is anotherPlayIsPossible() and isLegal() to check if there even is a pair
c. 0 = J♥ 1 = 6♣ 2 = 2♠ 3 = A♠ 4 = 4♥
d.
for(Card i, cIndexes)
{
	System.out.println(i);
}
e. isLegal() because it requires a List of cards which most likely cannot have
a null inside of it for the function to work.
